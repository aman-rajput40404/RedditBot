I was just going to say, it has a hint of h3h3 productions. We are getting there.
I smell notes of H3H3 productions, it wasn't quite there but so close. That ending.... LOL 

I didn't like how Ethan was reading the computer screen, and it felt like he had just quickly read up on this stuff. I miss when he did his own research, it just felt more natural when he talked about it. 

Great job Ethan.
Yeah, that is true. That happens when you have to walk on eggshells around someone you work with or a friend. I know this from personal experience, I think that is why I picked up on it from the beginning of the episode. It felt off.
